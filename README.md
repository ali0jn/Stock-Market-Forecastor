# Stock-Market-Forecastor
A console-based software which uses Machine Learning algorithms to create a classifier and based on that predict the future values of specific stock. This software only works with the dataset provide by the user and downloaded from finance.yahoo.com. Please place your historical csv metadata in the same working directory and rename it to data.csv. For testing purposes, the training data for Bitcoin (June 2014 to June 2019) has been downloaded and placed inside the directory under the name data.csv

You need to have Python 3 and some packages installed to fully run the code. You need to install pandas, sklearn and matplotlib packages installed. The minimum training data required for forecasting is 5 years.

I am waiting to hear about your feedback related to this software as you will be testing it better.
